# Fairtailen Website project

Creating a user friendly web interface with improved user navigation features and awesome animation effects to improve user engagements and turn visitors to partners and supporters of the 'fairtailen' project.

Welcome!

## Tools and Set-Up
For this project, we used React.Js- A javascript frontend library for building user interfaces. We used the following tools:
1) IDE - Visual Studios
2) git and github
3) NodeJs

Each tool installation can be done by simply following the download instructions provided next to each tool above

## Starting a React project with Create-React-App
- cd to project folder directory on terminal and run:
&`npx create-react-app fairtailen`.
Note that the fairtailen represents the name of our project in this case. The command creates a react project with a suitable folder structure upon which our development shall be based.

Once the download is complete....HAPPY HACKING.
To see what the default react template looks like before we begin building run:
& `npm start`.
This launches the ReactJs server with the react logo rotating at the background.

To get the FAIRTAILEN website running on your local computer, clone this repository with the `git clone <repo directory>` command, cd into the 'fairtailen' folder on your terminal and run `npm start`.
